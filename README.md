# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project is about predicting house prices in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. It was originally a real-life project that I was assigned to do during my internship in summer 2020. My roles for the project were only about data pre-processing and data analysis, so I never had to build models.
